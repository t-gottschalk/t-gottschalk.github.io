				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<p>Committed, hard-working, reliable, and confident with excellent communication and interpersonal skills. I enjoy working with other people to create positive collaborative experiences while learning new techniques and approaches from others with different skill sets and backgrounds. In my free time I enjoy traveling, hanging out with friends, exercising, and, of course, learning new technology.</p>
				<p>I have been in IT support and management my entire career: device support, servers, networks, infrastructure, vendor application, and business processes. This has lead me through a myriad of different industries including Health Care, Fortune 500, State Government, and Military. My latest professional endeavor is to come "full circle" in IT, challenge myself, and learn how to code. I have been humbled numerous times already during this new journey but am very excited and thankful for the opportunity set before me.</p>
